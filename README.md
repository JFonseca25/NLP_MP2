# NLP_MP2
A repository for the second project of our NLP course (2021/22). 

In this project, we had to test various machine learning models on the task of predicting the topic of a Question + Answer pair, while also playing with different types of preprocessing (e.g TfIDF, lowercasing, etc.). We were not allowed to use deep learning models. 

In the end, we had to choose the one that performed best. To do this, we used the Balanced Accuracy and Weighted F1 measures, and performed cross-validation.
